## _ANQR, A New Quick Response: A new type of qr code, with unlimited space._

[![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/joemccann/dillinger.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/joemccann/dillinger)

ANQR is a library that turns any string into a png file, 
No matter how big the string is!

## Features

- Make an image by typing in any string
- Read a string from an image (made with ANQR)

an ANQR image is an image that represents bits per pixel. It is then translated from binary to a string.

This text you see here is *actually- written in Markdown! To get a feel
for Markdown's syntax, type some text into the left window and
watch the results in the right.

## Tech

ANQR is built with these libraries (special thanks!):

- [PIL] - `PIL.Image` is used for the image processing and creating.
